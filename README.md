# Shared Document Editor (Google Docs Clone)

This project uses React on the client side and node.js on the server side, and uses a local installation of MongoDB for the database.

This is based off a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRaelG7v0OU&t=1s) by Kyle from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw). Check out his channel, and the courses he offers.

To start both the server and client simultaneously the package concurrently has been installed. To start both services change into the client folder and use the command:

``` javascript
npm run dev
```

This will start the node.js server and then the react client. The web page for editing files will automatically load and be ready for input.
